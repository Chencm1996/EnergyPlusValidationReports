- Version: 1.3.0.018
  Input-File-Changes: For Case 960, changed solar distribution option from FullExterior to FullInteriorAndExterior; also for case 960, corrected the order of coordinates for the common wall

- Version: 1.3.0.018
  Input-File-Changes: For all cases, began using a new Drycold weather file converted directly from TMY to EPW format with EnergyPlus weather converter; previously used a weather file that was first converted to BLAST format and then to EPW format.

- Version: 1.4.0.004
  Code-Changes: The sunlit area calculation for DOORS was corrected. This affected the results for Cases 200, 210, 215, 220, 230, 240, 250, 395, 400, 410, 420 and 430 where windows were replaced with an opaque surface which had been modeled as a DOOR. (CR6989)

- Version: 2.1.0.023
  Code-Changes: The methodology for handling solar diffuse through a window was completely reworked and was changed from uniform interior distribution of transmitted diffuse solar to distribution based on approximate view factors between transmitting windows and zone heat transfer surfaces. (CR7237)
  Description: |
    Significant changes also occurred in EnergyPlus version 2.1.0.023 where
    the methodology for treating window diffuse solar radiation within a
    zone was changed. The annual and peak heating results were less than
    those reported with version 2.0.0.025 and annual and peak cooling
    results were greater than those reported previously. Annual heating
    changed by as much as -2.7% and annual cooling changed by as much as +7%
    depending on the test case. Peak heating changed by as much as -0.3% and
    peak cooling changed by as much as +2.1% depending on the test case.

- Version: 3.0.0.028
  Code-Changes: The algorithm for variable system timestep was revised. Changes include uniform system timestep length across zone timestep and stricter management of history terms for zone air conditions.
  Description: |
    The change highlighted above for version 3.0.0.028 had only a small
    impact on results (usually \<0.5% change) compared to results obtained
    with version 2.2.0.023 except for the heating/cooling temperature
    setback cases 640 and 940. For both cases the annual heating decreased
    by about 5% while the peak heating decreased by 12-15%. In the case of
    640 peak heating, the impact was to move EnergyPlus to within the bounds
    of the other programs. In the case of 940 annual heating it moved
    EnergyPlus just outside the range of other programs.

- Version: 3.1.0.027
  Input-File-Changes: Changed SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Outside from Detailed to DOE-2 method.
  Code-Changes: The default for SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Outside was changed from Detailed to DOE-2 method. (CR7703)
  Description: |
    For EnergyPlus version 3.1.0.027, the default value for
    SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Outside was changed from Detailed to DOE-2
    method. This change was made because the Detailed method was flawed when
    applied to small surfaces or subsurfaces which are part of a larger
    overall building facade. The input files for the test suite were
    modified to use this new default method. The change to the DOE-2 outside
    convection coefficient algorithm in EnergyPlus version 3.1.0.027 had the
    overall result of reducing annual heating results and consequently for 3
    additional cases the EnergyPlus annual heating results moved outside the
    range of the other programs.

- Version: 4.0.0.013
  Code-Changes: Algorithms for window convection coefficients were changed (CR7820)
  Description: |
    For EnergyPlus 4.0.0.013, the window convection coefficient algorithms
    were changed due to errors which occurred when temperatures were out of
    range and with one routine where the temperature being passed was in K
    rather than C.

- Version: 4.0.0.024
  Input-File-Changes: For Case 960 the Common Wall (wall between conditioned zone and sunspace) solar absorptance was changed from 0.75 to 0.60 to conform to specification.
  Description: |
    For EnergyPlus version 4.0.0.024, the solar absorptance for the Common
    Wall separating the conditioned zone and the sunspace in Case 960 was
    changed from 0.75 to 0.60, correcting an input error. As a result the
    annual heating increased by 3.7% and the annual cooling decreased by
    4.0% bringing both results closer to the middle of the range of results
    for the other programs.

- Version: 6.0.0.012
  Input-File-Changes: Changed SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Inside from Detailed to TARP which gives same results; eliminated the ZoneCapacitanceMultiplier object to let it default

- Version: 7.1.0.007
  Code-Changes: The interpolation of rain and snow flags in the weather data was revised to better match how the other weather data are interpolated. (CR8800)

- Version: 7.1.0.012
  Description: |
    For EnergyPlus version 7.1.0.012, the interpolation of the rain and snow
    flags in the weather data was revised to better match how other weather
    data are interpolated. This had a small impact on exterior surface heat
    transfer due to changes in the surface exterior film coefficient and
    temperature difference across the surface. Changes on the order of 0.5%
    or less occurred in annual zone heating or zone annual sensible cooling
    for many test cases.

- Version: 7.2.0.006
  Code-Changes: The model coefficients for the DOE-2 outside face convection correlations were changed
  Description: |
    In version 7.2.0.006 the model coefficients for the DOE-2 outside face
    convection correlations were changed which resulted in annual heating
    loads increasing by as much as 5.5% and annual cooling loads decreasing
    by as much as 12.2%.

- Version: 8.2.0
  Input-File-Changes: Corrected error in Case 800, changed floor construction from LTFLOOR to HWFLOOR
  Code-Changes: EnergyPlus code was converted to C++
  Description: |
    In version 8.2.0 an error was found with the input for Case 800 and
    corrected. The floor construction had been previously specified as light
    weight construction (LWFLOOR) and should be heavy weight construction
    (HWFLOOR). The result was a reduction of 1% in annual heating and peak
    heating and a reduction of 17% in annual cooling and peak cooling.
    Results remained within the bounds of the other test program results.

    For EnergyPlus version 8.2.0, the source code was converted from FORTRAN
    to C++. This produced negligible differences in results.

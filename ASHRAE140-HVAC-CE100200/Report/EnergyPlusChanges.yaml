- Version: 1.0.2.003 thru 1.0.2.006
  Code-Changes: Reformatted and changed the H~fg~ psychrometric function to conform with ASHRAE equations

- Version: 1.0.3.001 thru 1.0.3.013
  Code-Changes: Added H~g~ psychrometric function as per ASHRAE equations and now use this for latent gain conversion to humidity ratio

- Version: 1.3.0.018
  Code-Changes: Change in the algorithm for calculating the cooling coil outlet conditions for the Window Air Conditioner model (CR 6772)

- Version: 1.3.018
  Input-File-Changes: Turned off the local surface temperature and wind calculation in the new SITE ATMOSPHERIC VARIATION object

- Version: 1.4.0.025
  Code-Changes: Changed DX coil sensible and latent outlet calculations to make them consistent with Window Air Conditioner outlet calculations. DX coil and Window Air Conditioner total cooling remained unchanged but the split between sensible and latent coil load did change. (CR 7092)

- Version: 2.2.0.023
  Input-File-Changes: Used EnergyPlus weather files created from TMY2 formatted files provided with Standard 140-2007. Prior results used TMY weather files.

- Version: 3.0.0.028
  Code-Changes: The algorithm for variable system timestep was revised. Changes include uniform system timestep length across zone timestep and stricter management of history terms for zone air conditions.

- Version: 7.1.0.007
  Code-Changes: The interpolation of rain and snow flags in the weather data was revised to better match how the other weather data are interpolated. (CR8800)

- Version: 7.2.0.006
  Code-Changes: The model coefficients for the DOE-2 outside face convection correlations were changed. This had no impact on results for this test suite since the building was intended as a near-adiabatic test cell with cooling loads driven by internal gains.

- Version: 8.2.0
  Code-Changes: EnergyPlus code was converted to C++

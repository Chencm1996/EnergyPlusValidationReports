- Version: 1.0.1.017
  Input-File-Changes: Added 50 watt parasitic load for draft fan
  Code-Changes: Added capability to gas heating coil object to allow parasitic load input for draft fan

- Version: 1.0.1.031
  Code-Changes: Added part load performance curve for heating coil

- Version: 1.0.1.038
  Code-Changes: Changed fan HIR versus PLR part load simulation logic

- Version: 1.1.0.020
  Code-Changes: Added code to iterate for the case of cycling fan, cycling coil when the heater has a part-load performance curve. This was needed to correctly account for the amount of fan heat, with the balance of the heating load being picked up by the heater

- Version: 1.2.2.015
  Code-Changes: Changed reference for furnace capacity from return air node to zone node

- Version: 1.2.2.016
  Code-Changes: Changed convergence technique for furnace to be percent of load instead of absolute watts

- Version: 1.2.2.024
  Code-Changes: Corrected PartLoadRatio for the furnace which was not initialized prior to use

- Version: 1.2.2.030
  Code-Changes: Used EnergyPlus weather files created from WYEC2 formatted files provided by NCR. Set surface convection coefficients manually to that required in test specification using new CONVECTIONCOEFFICIENTS object. Changed loads convergence tolerance from 0.03999999 to 0.00000004. Changed temperature convergence tolerance from 0.0040000 to 0.0000004. Corrected heating coil capacity to 5000 W for Case 2c; previously was erroneously set to 10,000 W

- Version: 1.3.0.018
  Input-File-Changes: Turned off the surface vertical temperature adjustment in the new SITE ATMOSPHERIC VARIATION object

- Version: 2.2.0.023
  Input-File-Changes: Used EnergyPlus weather files created from WYEC2 formatted files provided with Standard 140-2007

- Version: 3.0.0.028
  Code-Changes: The algorithm for variable system timestep was revised. Changes include uniform system timestep length across zone timestep and stricter management of history terms for zone air conditions.

- Version: 3.1.0.027
  Code-Changes: Corrected fan run-time fraction calculation for on-off fan when gas heating coil PLF curve output is greater than 1. (CR7689)

- Version: 8.2.0
  Code-Changes: The EnergyPlus source code was converted from FORTRAN to C++. This produced negligible differences in results.
